About:
This file includes both the .png and an editable .psd I uploaded this model to LSPDFR expecting it to just sit there and fade into darkness but after seeing Milly create a really cool mod using my model I decided why not chuck it up here too! Hope everyone enjoys I've included a PSD file for those who want to edit the model and make it better feel free to change it as much as you want e.t.c.


**Base Model is just there for quick and ease of access to the base model**
